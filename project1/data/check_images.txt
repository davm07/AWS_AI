No, each model had different results. The Alexnet model classified the second image as a bloodhound or sleuthhound. The Resnet model classified it as a chihuahua, and the final VGG model classified it as a balance beam or beam. In other words, they all classified it the same in image 1, but the classification in image 2 was different for all models.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I think the model that performed best was Alexnet, as it recognized that the second image was somehow related to the first image of the dogs. It classified the second image of the dog as a bloodhound and a sleuthhound; these dogs are ancestors of the English Foxhound. The other models failed to recognize this.
