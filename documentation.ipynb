    "You are optimizing a machine learning pipeline, and you need to report the processing time of a dataset in a human-readable format. The time is provided in days, and you need to convert it to weeks and days to better communicate the processing schedule to the stakeholders.\n",

    "Write a function named readable_processing_time. The function should take one argument, an integer days, and return a string that says how many weeks and days that is."
