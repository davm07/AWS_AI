    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. Preparing text data for NER involves ensuring that the text strings fit within specified limits and are correctly formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "You are preparing text data for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. You need to ensure that the full name of a person fits within a specified character limit for a named entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Use string concatenation and the `len()` function to find the length of the given name, including spaces. Store the length in the variable `name_length`."
